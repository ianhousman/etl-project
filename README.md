# ETL-Project

### Contributors: Ian Housman, Abdullah Almasri, Hisham Elhassan

### Data Sets 

#### (1)  https://www.kaggle.com/gagandeep16/car-sales

#### (2)  https://data.world/amercader/car-fuel-emissions-2000-2013

## Background 

Our project was to extract two sources of data into a Python kernel, transform the sets of data to fit our liking, and load them into an online database. For our sets of data, we chose a CSV file from kaggle.com that showed the sales of many different car manufacturers, and another CSV file from data.world that looked at fuel emissions from each car manufacturer and model.
